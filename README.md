## Welcome

People use GitHub to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can help you do it even better. GitHub Skills’ “Introduction to GitHub” course guides you through everything you need to start contributing in less than an hour.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, and students.
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
- **What you'll build**: We'll make a short Markdown file you can use as your [profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
- **Prerequisites**: None. This course is a great introduction for your first day on GitHub.
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a branch
2. Commit a file
3. Open a pull request
4. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'introduction-to-github',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-introduction-to-github',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
